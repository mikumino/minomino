        <p class="mb-4">Welcome to my website! This is mostly a place for me to dump all of my thoughts about Japanese learning, but there are other things too! lol. There are tons of resources and guides out there for learning Japanese, and I wanted to create a place where I can put everything I've used into one place that I can easily share with friends.</p>
