Yomichan is a browser extension that allows you to quickly look up Japanese words while reading text on a web page. In conjuction with other tools, it can be a convenient way to make Anki cards in no more than a few clicks.

Unfortunately, development of Yomichan has been discontinued. There are community forks of the project, with Yomibaba being the one used in this guide. **It's important to note that when following this guide you must use Yomibaba and not Yomichan.**

## Installation
1. Go to the [Yomibaba releases page](https://github.com/forsakeninfinity/yomibaba/releases) and download the latest version of the extension for your browser.

2. Extract the zip file somewhere convenient. You're free to delete the zip file but do not delete the folder even after installation.
