Anki is a flashcard program that allows you to create, study, and review flashcards. While not necessary for learning Japanese, it can be quite useful for familiarizing yourself with new vocabulary.

This page only convers general Anki set-up. **If you're looking to set up Anki for mining, please go to the [Anki for Mining](/personal-guides/basic-mining) page.**

These are just Refold's recommended settings. You're free to change them to your liking.

## Set-up
1. Download Anki [**here**](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). Make sure it is the one labeled Qt6.
    <Image src={img1} alt="anki download page" class='mx-auto rounded-xl w-full' />
2. Now we need to change some Anki settings.
    1. Open the deck options
        <Image src={img2} alt="anki deck options" class='mx-auto rounded-xl w-full' />        
    2. Copy these settings
        <Image src={img3} alt="anki deck options part 2" class='mx-auto rounded-xl w-full' />
        <Image src={img4} alt="anki deck" class='mx-auto rounded-xl w-full' />
    3. Click save
3. Next, you need to download a deck. I recommend [this deck](https://anacreondjt.gitlab.io/docs/coredeck/) for a free deck. To add it to Anki, all you need to do is open the file.
4. Now you can study from this deck!
    1. Your first session will be really really short. They will become longer as time goes on (around 20-30 minutes per session). I usually just do Anki in the morning.
