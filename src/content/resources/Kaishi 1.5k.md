This deck was made a while after I had already gotten through the usual beginner stuff, but at a cursory glance it looks quite nice. I know a few people who are getting through or have already gotten through the deck and I hear good things about it from them.

While it's not the deck that I used, it's the one I recommend to most people starting out with Japanese nowadays.
