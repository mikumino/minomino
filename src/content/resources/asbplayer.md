asbplayer is the video player I currently use. My favorite alternative is **mpv**, which I actually consider superior in a lot of ways. However, asbplayer is extremely simple to set up, and if you're the type that prefers to stream rather than torrent, it is insanely easy to use for streaming. 

I quite like the workflow I have right now of having my automation tools retrieve media and then just mining straight out of Plex, so it's been my video player of choice recently.
